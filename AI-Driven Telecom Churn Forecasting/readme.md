## Business Problem

1. Customer Churn Prediction: Identify which customers are likely to stop using a product or service.
2. Pricing Strategy Analysis: Evaluate and refine pricing models to maximize revenue and competitiveness.
3. Optimizing Product Bundles: Determine the best combination of products to increase sales and customer satisfaction.

## Analytical Approach

Our analytic approach focuses on developing a predictive model to predict churn prediction for telecom companny is going to occur or not. We will analyze churn data, perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and test various machine learning algorithms. We also used Artificial Neural Network(ANN) to increase overall accuracy.
