## Business Problem.
1) Supply Chain & Risk Management: Enabling businesses to anticipate weather-related disruptions, especially in logistics and construction sectors.
2) Disaster Preparedness & Response: Helping governments and NGOs plan for floods or landslides, improving emergency response strategies.
3) Agricultural Planning: Helping farmers optimize crop planting and harvesting schedules to reduce losses due to unpredictable rainfall.
4) Water Resource Management: Assisting government and utility companies in planning water storage and distribution in drought-prone areas.

## Analytical Approach.
Our analytic approach focuses on developing a predictive model to predict rainfall is going to occur or not. We will analyze historical weather data, perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and test various machine learning algorithms. We also used Artificial Neural Network(ANN) to increase overall accuracy.

These are the features we used to predict rainfall.
